# rudra-webdev-project

Its me Raj Kumar jaiswa. I have created a small project as per the question.

I have created the different folder so you can easy see all my codes of HTML,CSS and JS.

To run this code simply copy paste this in visual stdio code and it will run.

As per the question no 1. I have to create website similar to Hacker Typer. and one keyboard shortcut that when pressed splits the webpage into two halves. 
but i don't know how to created this shortcut so i have created websited similar to hacker typer in which we can do fun by typing anyting on keyboard but in PC it will sHOW like we are doing hacking "Sounds interesting".
